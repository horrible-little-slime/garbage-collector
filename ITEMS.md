# IOTMs and Useful Items used by Garbo

In an ideal world, Garbo is supposed to be a flexible script that operates successfully for users regardless of their existing IOTM loadout. While Garbo has -support- for quite a lot of IOTMs, it doesn't really -require- any of them -- Garbo will do its best to make you as much meat as possible given the resources available to you. All that said, there are a few (relatively) cheap items that Garbo uses that can be useful to pick up. While Garbo does buy things like your diet & your potions, these are items where Garbo will not purchase them itself (as they don't pay for themselves in one distinct session of Garbo), but do make Garbo better enough to be worth looking into acquiring.

## "Cheap" items worth acquiring (<10 million)

| mafia pointer finger ring                      | Accessory | Gain meat on critical hits. Bad for embezzlers, but generally worn rest of the Barf day. The easiest way to make use of it is to go Seal Clubber for access to Furious Wallop - a guaranteed critical hit skill. It is worth noting that unlike most of these items, this often peaks a little over 10 million; this is unfortunate, but this is one of the most valuable individual things you can buy to improve your take, so we must suggest it here. (And note that as an unbound item, you can sell it when you're done with it! Garbo also supports using pointer finger from a stash clan, so if you and your buddies want to share one, make a clan with an in-joke name and go nuts.) |

Those are our best recommendations for a handful of relatively cheap things Garbo uses that you may want to look into purchasing, as they effectively pay for themselves.

It's entirely possible to mount a respectable setup using just these items and relevant permanent skills, as shown in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19BvfkftgcgBHDVqllMRaCPvoGeys0tSke51VBH2bjiw/edit#gid=217654304). You are assumed to be a Seal Clubber, for Furious Wallop critical hits, in possession of Transcendent Olfaction and all relevant +meat% and +item% skills made permanent, and sporting a number of the gear options outlined above. This results in 3,600 MPA, which is preferable to Volcano farming. Adding a solitary IotM in SongBoom Boombox to this setup upgrades the MPA to 4,000. If you are a very low-IOTM player, please feel free to make a copy of this sheet and try to assess whether you can successfully run Garbo with your loadout.

It is worth noting that, despite this, Garbo is not for everybody. Volcano farming produces an MPA of 3,400, which is less than than the no-IOTM MPA on the sheet above, but more than the MPA you'll get if you remove some of the big pieces of the sheet (like Hobo Monkey). The reason that folks tend to still recommend Garbo is that Garbo is a very expansive script that gets better every single shiny you have. Almost every IOTM gets eventually used for -something- in Garbo, and as a result, as you start generating enough meat to buy shiny toys from Mr. Store, your MPA will naturally get higher and you will eventually dwarf the high floor of Volcano farming. Also, it is worth noting that Volcano daypasses are much, much more expensive than Dinseylandfill passes, so you end up still breaking positive with Garbo over Volcano down to something along the lines of 3,200 or 3,100 MPA. Still, this is an important piece of math to do to figure out your own situation. Good luck!
